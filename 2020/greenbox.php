                <p class="serif">As the global community aims to deliver on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, depending on governments to facilitate the change and funding for the same, it deems to be extremely slow to meet the target. Citizens, governments and investors are now increasingly looking at the companies to take responsibility and address these societal challenges. The first step towards that is for the companies to take accountability of their own sustainable practices and make that transparently available for their investors and consumers. The medium: ESG reporting (Environmental, Social and Governance) factors have only recently begun to have financial relevance to companies. Yet, ESG performance is still under-reported, with the onus for complete disclosure being solely in the companies’ hands. Using this report an impact investor analyzes the sustainability performance and accountability of the company and thus invests responsibly. The value that this investor possesses is called ‘Blended Value’ where he/she considers all, environmental, social and economic performance to make an investment.</p>

                <p class="serif">We have created a platform to nudge investors towards impact investing by creating novel data representations and interactions with companies’ sustainability and financial data by incorporating facets of ‘ESG’ and ‘Sign Value’ using natural language processing and fuzzy algorithms. We present to you GreenBox: An ESG Stock Indicator. GreenBox is a plugin that can be updated or linked to one’ s portfolio. Instead of huge risks and portfolio transformations to start investing sustainably, the platform helps in setting comfortable value targets for a portion or percentage of investments as impact investments.</p>
