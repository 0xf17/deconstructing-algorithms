                <p class="serif big mt-5 mb-3">What if users could interact with elements they see on the user interface, inspect the digital systems they use, and understand the algorithm-driven processes behind them?</p>

                <p class="serif">With back-end algorithmic processes becoming increasingly obscured and vastly complex, users are often unaware of the rationale employed behind the services they use. There is a call for a new kind of literacy. This project proposes ‘Algorithmic literacy’, which brings to the forefront information about algorithmic processes that automate and augment tasks users engage with on digital services. What one's agency is in algorithmic decision making and what actions they can control on a digital service are also parts of the proposed algorithmic literacy.</p>
                <p class="serif">To achieve this vision, the project identifies ‘Explainable AI’ as a methodology which inspects and explains the steps and models involved at the back-end of artificial intelligence technology and makes it apparent and understandable for users.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="serif">While looking to engage users with this information, it is important to locate relevant factors that are understandable, and meaningful for them to decide the extent of their relationship with these services. When using Explainable AI methodologies as a medium to make obscured algorithmic processes apparent, this project finds it imperative to look at users as new learners, informing their decisions by ways of explainability that are borrowed from pedagogy and instructional design.</p>

                <p class="serif">The project proposes to relook at users as learners, and their interactions with digital services as a ‘site for learning’. We propose Algo-Lit plug which helps users understand their preferences, available user controls on a digital service, understand what different User Interface elements mean and how they contribute in the decision making of the algorithmic processes and the entire system of decision making. The project is a speculation of explainability of AI features for end-users.</p>
