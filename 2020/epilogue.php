                <p class="serif">The brief, to ‘deconstruct algorithms’ is not an easy one - because these ‘intangible instructions’ remain ‘hidden’ from average humans, who go about their daily lives in a more-or-less ‘tangible’ world. Irrespective of where they are deployed, functioning in the background, these algorithms remain unquestioningly sincere to the human minds that built them. And, more often than not, may also have embedded within them, innocently, the intelligences, interests and biases of their creators. Not to speak of the unexpected powers algorithms can acquire over time, as they evolve through learning the environments they are deployed in, both human and non-human.</p>

                 <p class="serif">This leads to the following few pertinent questions among many…Can we humans understand algorithms enough to be able to work with them as they evolve - and rather than beasts we cannot relate to after a point in time, can they continue to remain as powerful tools, as they would have originally been envisioned to be - and continue to operate as allies, towards more equitable and plural futures? Can we imagine more inclusive futures where the understanding of algorithms is as ubiquitous and ‘normal’ as their own proliferation and omnipresence? And therefore, curiously enough, can we truly ‘deconstruct’ these potent human creations called ‘algorithms’ - to then enable their ‘more conscious constructions’?</p>

                 <p class="serif">No work of significance is accomplished overnight, and this is most certainly true for visionary endeavours such as this - where the need is to challenge, and eventually push the status quo. And, although there are more possibilities to explore, more worlds to address, more work left, always! - the two projects, Greenbox and Deciphering Algorithms are pertinent steps in the right direction - wherein the visions have been not to produce mere thesis projects, but pieces of work that act as symbols of possibility of what more humane and inclusive futures can be.</p>

                 <p class="serif">From breaking down words to understand the constructs of a language, to exploring Derrida’s theories, to coming up with ‘Oribaka’, an experimental language to communicate origami instructions, what I have thoroughly enjoyed as an observer throughout as the project flowed its natural course has been the richness of the explorations. And, although these five bright, enthused minds along with their visionary mentor, Gaurav, might have envisaged the journey of this project differently - given the sudden challenges posed by the pandemic (which requires no elaborate mention), it is most certain that what they have finally arrived at together may have not been in their remotest collective imaginations.</p>

                 <p class="serif">Tenacious and determined as each one of them is, in her own way, what is really promising about Apoorva, Daksha, Nupur, Shreya and Simran is their genuine passion to not just prepare for the future, but actively build it, through their conscious, informed efforts. And their dreams and actions for a better world only give me more hope in the future - of these five spirited individuals of course! - but also of the world that tomorrow will be!</p>

                 <p class="serif">Shine your light on the world girls, your time has come!</p>
